## Lab 2

### App Description
The user can tap the "Add New Card" button to add a new flashcard. From there, they are brought to the screen where they can enter a question and answer for that card. They can either click the "Cancel" button to exit the screen or the "Done" button to make their new card with the data they entered. If they don't enter a question and/or an answer, an error appears, indicating the user must fill out both fields.

Note: The data of the old card is overwritten in the process of "creating" a new card. The process of saving data from multiple cards will be dealt with in Lab 3.
